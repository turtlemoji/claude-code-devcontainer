# Claude Code in a devcontainer

A sandboxed development environment for running Claude Code with `bypassPermissions` safely enabled. Built at [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) for security audit workflows.

## Why Use This?

Running Claude with `bypassPermissions` on your host machine is risky—it can execute any command without confirmation. This devcontainer provides **filesystem isolation** so you get the productivity benefits of unrestricted Claude without risking your host system.

**Designed for:**

- **Security audits**: Review client code without risking your host
- **Untrusted repositories**: Explore unknown codebases safely
- **Experimental work**: Let Claude modify code freely in isolation
- **Multi-repo engagements**: Work on multiple related repositories

## Prerequisites

- **Docker runtime** (one of):
  - [Docker Desktop](https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - ensure it's running
  - [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/)
  - [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima): `brew install colima docker && colima start`

- **For terminal workflows** (one-time install):

  ```bash
  npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
  git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/claude-code-devcontainer ~/.claude-devcontainer
  ~/.claude-devcontainer/install.sh self-install
  ```

- **(Optional) [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/)** — only if you want
  kernel-level isolation via `devc kata`. Requires a Linux host with hardware
  virtualization (KVM) and the runtime registered with Docker. Not needed for the
  default `devc .` workflow. See [Kernel Isolation with Kata](#kernel-isolation-with-kata)
  for setup.

<summary><strong>Optimizing Colima for Apple Silicon</strong></summary>

Colima's defaults (QEMU + sshfs) are conservative. For better performance:

```bash
# Stop and delete current VM (removes containers/images)
colima stop && colima delete

# Start with optimized settings
colima start \
  --cpu 4 \
  --memory 8 \
  --disk 100 \
  --vm-type vz \
  --vz-rosetta \
  --mount-type virtiofs
```

Adjust `--cpu` and `--memory` based on your Mac (e.g., 6/16 for Pro, 8/32 for Max).

| Option | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| `--vm-type vz` | Apple Virtualization.framework (faster than QEMU) |
| `--mount-type virtiofs` | 5-10x faster file I/O than sshfs |
| `--vz-rosetta` | Run x86 containers via Rosetta |

Verify with `colima status` - should show "macOS Virtualization.Framework" and "virtiofs".

## Quick Start

Choose the pattern that fits your workflow:

### Pattern A: Per-Project Container (Isolated)

Each project gets its own container with independent volumes. Best for one-off reviews, untrusted repos, or when you need isolation between projects.

**Terminal:**

```bash
git clone <untrusted-repo>
cd untrusted-repo
devc .          # Installs template + starts container
devc shell      # Opens shell in container
```

**VS Code / Cursor:**

1. Install the Dev Containers extension:
   - VS Code: `ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`
   - Cursor: `anysphere.remote-containers`

2. Set up the devcontainer (choose one):

   ```bash
   # Option A: Use devc (recommended)
   devc .

   # Option B: Clone manually
   git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/claude-code-devcontainer .devcontainer/
   ```

3. Open **your project folder** in VS Code, then:
   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
   - Type "Reopen in Container" and select **Dev Containers: Reopen in Container**

### Pattern B: Shared Workspace Container (Grouped)

A parent directory contains the devcontainer config, and you clone multiple repos inside. Shared volumes across all repos. Best for client engagements, related repositories, or ongoing work.

```bash
# Create workspace for a client engagement
mkdir -p ~/sandbox/client-name
cd ~/sandbox/client-name
devc .          # Install template + start container
devc shell      # Opens shell in container

# Inside container:
git clone <client-repo-1>
git clone <client-repo-2>
cd client-repo-1
claude          # Ready to work
```

## Token-Based Auth (Headless)

For headless servers or to skip the interactive login wizard:

```bash
claude setup-token                          # run on host, one-time
export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=sk-ant-oat01-...
devc rebuild                                # rebuilds with token
```

The token is forwarded into the container. On each container creation, `post_install.py` runs a one-shot auth handshake so `claude` starts without the login wizard.

This works around Claude Code's interactive onboarding wizard always showing in containers, even with valid credentials ([#8938](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/8938)).

If you don't set a token, the interactive login flow works as before.

## CLI Helper Commands

```
devc .              Install template + start container in current directory
devc kata [runtime] Same as '.', but with Kata kernel isolation (VM-backed)
devc up             Start the devcontainer
devc rebuild        Rebuild container (preserves persistent volumes)
devc destroy [-f]   Remove container, volumes, and image for current project
devc down           Stop the container
devc shell          Open zsh shell in container
devc exec CMD       Execute command inside the container
devc upgrade        Upgrade Claude Code in the container
devc mount SRC DST  Add a bind mount (host → container)
devc sync [NAME]    Sync Claude Code sessions from devcontainers to host
devc template DIR   Copy devcontainer files to directory
devc self-install   Install devc to ~/.local/bin
```

> **Note:** Use `devc destroy` to clean up a project's Docker resources. Removing containers manually (e.g., `docker rm`) will leave orphaned volumes and images behind that `devc destroy` won't be able to find.

## Session Sync for `/insights`

Claude Code's `/insights` command analyzes your session history, but it only reads from `~/.claude/projects/` on the host. Sessions inside devcontainer volumes are invisible to it.

`devc sync` copies session logs from all devcontainers (running and stopped) to the host so `/insights` can include them:

```bash
devc sync              # Sync all devcontainers
devc sync crypto       # Filter by project name (substring match)
```

Devcontainers are auto-discovered via Docker labels — no need to know container names or IDs. The sync is incremental, so it's safe to run repeatedly.

## File Sharing

### VS Code / Cursor

Drag files from your host into the VS Code Explorer panel — they are copied into `/workspace/` automatically. No configuration needed.

### Terminal: `devc mount`

To make a host directory available inside the container:

```bash
devc mount ~/drop /drop           # Read-write
devc mount ~/secrets /secrets --readonly
```

This adds a bind mount to `devcontainer.json` and recreates the container. Existing mounts are preserved across `devc template` updates.

**Tip:** A shared "drop folder" is useful for passing files in without mounting your entire home directory.

> **Security note:** Avoid mounting large host directories (e.g., `$HOME`). Every mounted path is writable from inside the container unless `--readonly` is specified, which undermines the filesystem isolation this project provides.

## Network Isolation

By default, containers have full outbound network access. For stricter security, use iptables to restrict network access.

### When to Enable Network Isolation

- Reviewing code that may contain malicious dependencies
- Auditing software with telemetry or phone-home behavior
- Maximum isolation for highly sensitive reviews

### Example: Claude + GitHub + Package Registries

```bash
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d api.anthropic.com -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d github.com -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d raw.githubusercontent.com -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d registry.npmjs.org -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d pypi.org -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d files.pythonhosted.org -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP
```

### Trade-offs

- Blocks package managers unless you allowlist registries
- May break tools that require network access
- DNS resolution still works (consider blocking if paranoid)

## Kernel Isolation with Kata

By default, the container shares your **host's kernel**. Filesystem and process isolation are enforced by namespaces and cgroups, but a kernel-level exploit or container-escape vulnerability would land directly on the host kernel. For higher-assurance reviews of genuinely untrusted code, run the container under [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/), which executes each container inside a lightweight VM with its **own guest kernel**. A successful escape then lands in a disposable VM instead of on your host.

```bash
devc kata          # Install template + start, under the Kata runtime
```

`devc kata` works exactly like `devc .` — it installs the template and starts the container — but injects `--runtime=<kata>` into `runArgs` and verifies the runtime is registered with Docker before launching.

### Runtime name

The runtime name is whatever you registered with the Docker daemon, so it's configurable. `devc kata` defaults to `kata-runtime`; override it with a positional argument or the `DEVC_KATA_RUNTIME` environment variable:

```bash
devc kata io.containerd.kata.v2        # containerd shim name
DEVC_KATA_RUNTIME=kata devc kata       # custom daemon.json name
```

### Host setup (one-time)

Kata requires a Linux host with hardware virtualization (KVM):

1. Install [Kata Containers](https://github.com/kata-containers/kata-containers/blob/main/docs/install/README.md).
2. Register it in `/etc/docker/daemon.json`:

   ```json
   { "runtimes": { "kata-runtime": { "path": "/usr/bin/kata-runtime" } } }
   ```

3. Restart Docker: `sudo systemctl restart docker`
4. Verify: `docker info --format '{{.Runtimes}}'`

If the runtime isn't registered, `devc kata` stops with setup instructions instead of a cryptic Docker error.

> **macOS note:** Kata needs nested virtualization. Docker Desktop and Colima run Linux inside a VM that generally does **not** expose KVM on Apple Silicon, so Kata typically won't work there. Use a Linux host (bare metal or a VM with nested virt enabled) for kernel isolation.

### Trade-offs

- Requires Kata + KVM on the host (see above); not available on most macOS setups.
- Slightly slower container startup and higher memory overhead (a VM is booted per container).
- Bind mounts (including `/workspace`) are shared into the guest via virtio-fs, so file I/O may differ in performance from a plain container.

## Threat Model

The primary threat this project addresses is **Claude Code running arbitrary commands on your host machine**. When `bypassPermissions` is enabled, Claude executes shell commands, installs packages, and modifies files without confirmation. On a host machine this means it can modify your shell config, `rm -rf` outside the project directory, or abuse locally stored credentials. The devcontainer confines all of that to a disposable container where the blast radius is limited to `/workspace`.

The container includes common development tooling so you can do all development work inside it - not just run Claude. The intended workflow is: clone a repository, start the devcontainer, and work entirely within it. If your project needs additional runtimes or tools beyond what's included, either add them to the Dockerfile for repeated use or install them ad-hoc with `devc exec`.

For the specific boundaries of what is and isn't isolated, see [Security Model](#security-model) below. One nuance worth calling out: the devcontainer runtime automatically forwards your host's SSH agent socket (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`) into the container. This lets code inside the container authenticate as you over SSH (e.g., `git push`), but the actual private key material stays on the host and is never exposed to the container.

## Security Model

This devcontainer provides **filesystem isolation** but not complete sandboxing.

**Sandboxed:** Filesystem (host files inaccessible), processes (isolated from host), package installations (stay in container)

**Not sandboxed:** Network (full outbound by default—see [Network Isolation](#network-isolation)), git identity (`~/.gitconfig` mounted read-only), SSH agent (socket forwarded, keys stay on host), Docker socket (not mounted by default), **host kernel** (shared by default—see [Kernel Isolation with Kata](#kernel-isolation-with-kata))

The container auto-configures `bypassPermissions` mode—Claude runs commands without confirmation. This would be risky on a host machine, but the container itself is the sandbox.

By default the container shares the host kernel, so a kernel exploit or container escape would reach the host. For untrusted code where that matters, run under Kata (`devc kata`) to give the container its own guest kernel inside a VM.

## Container Details

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Base | Ubuntu 24.04, Node.js 22, Python 3.13 + uv, zsh |
| User | `vscode` (passwordless sudo), working dir `/workspace` |
| Tools | `rg`, `fd`, `tmux`, `fzf`, `delta`, `iptables`, `ipset` |
| Volumes (survive rebuilds) | Command history (`/commandhistory`), Claude config (`~/.claude`), GitHub CLI auth (`~/.config/gh`) |
| Host mounts | `~/.gitconfig` (read-only), `.devcontainer/` (read-only) |
| Auto-configured | [anthropics](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-plugins) + [trailofbits](https://github.com/trailofbits/claude-code-plugins) skills, git-delta |

Volumes are stored outside the container, so your shell history, Claude settings, and `gh` login persist even after `devc rebuild`. Host `~/.gitconfig` is mounted read-only for git identity.

## Troubleshooting

### "devcontainer CLI not found"

```bash
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
```

### Container won't start

1. Check Docker is running
2. Try rebuilding: `devc rebuild`
3. Check logs: `docker logs $(docker ps -lq)`

### GitHub CLI auth not persisting

The gh volume may need ownership fix:

```bash
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) ~/.config/gh
```

### Python/uv not working

Python is managed via uv:

```bash
uv run script.py              # Run a script
uv add package                # Add project dependency
uv run --with requests py.py  # Ad-hoc dependency
```

## Development

Build the image manually:

```bash
devcontainer build --workspace-folder .
```

Test the container:

```bash
devcontainer up --workspace-folder .
devcontainer exec --workspace-folder . zsh
```
